# Random Meal Generator

## Description
This simple JavaScript program selects three random ingredients to help you create your next meal!

It will choose the following for you:

1. A main ingredient
2. A vegetable
3. A sauce

Don't forget - if you don't like a particular ingredient you can just run the program again for another idea!

## How to Install and Run the Project
This program uses JavaScript so download the randomMealGenerator.js file then run using node.js.

## How to Use the Project
Use node in the command line to run the program.

e.g. node randomMealGenerator.js

If you'd prefer a vegetarian suggestion then add 'veggie' as an argument.

e.g. node randomMealGenerator.js veggie
